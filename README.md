# Importing Libraries

Before proceeding further importing the necessary libraries is important. In this dashboard, we use streamlit, plotly to visualize our data.

1. import streamlit as st
2. from streamlit_option_menu import option_menu
3. import pandas as pd
4. import mysql.connector
5. import plotly.express as px
6. import requests
7. import json

# Connecting to Database

Next, we connect to the database where we stored our six data frames which are transformed in a way to best suit the visualization.

#SQL Connection

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(host = '', user = '', password = '', database = '')

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# Streamlit Program

Here use your imagination and create your dashboard using stremlit, If you look at my dashboard function block it has various charts and dataframes displayed using plotly graph. likewise, you could also try to visualize in a more better and efficient way.

You can view your streamlit file by using, streamlit run "YOUR FILE NAME"

# Conclusion

The final product of this project is the live geo visualization dashboard that displays information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
